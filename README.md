# Weather-App
## About my first project on GitHub
This is a local webpage that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get data from the website and displays it
The JavaScript code is a basic weather app that:

1. Waits for the user to enter a city name and click the search button.
2. Fetches the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. Updates the webpage with either the weather information or an error message if the city isn't found.

### The JavaScript code is commented for an in deptha analysis
